## Install!
To install this its pretty simple, download the release from the /releases page then navigate to chrome://extensions on your device, click load unpacked, right click the zip file in the file manager(2 fingers) and press extract all. Then press on the newly created folder and press done. Now you will see a page with keyboard shortcuts, for each assignment press the pencil on the right and do that shortcut. Ex: ctrl+c (you wouldnt put a +)
